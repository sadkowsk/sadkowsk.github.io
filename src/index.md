# Welcome to my portfolio.

Here, you’ll learn about my work as an international educator—from a Senegalese community radio station to a meat packing plant in Iowa.

I currently serve as the project coordinator for the _Sesame Street_ Archive, an initiative of the Learning and Neurodevelopment Lab at Vanderbilt University. Earning my M.Ed. in International Education Policy & Management (Vanderbilt University ’24) and B.A. in History and Global Development Studies (Grinnell College ’16), my formal training includes data-informed policy analysis and program evaluation. My extensive international experiences and my Polish-Belarusian heritage also inform my commitment to education across borders.

In daily life, I enjoy cooking for friends, treasure hunting at garage sales, walking on trails, and smiling at passing strangers’ dogs.

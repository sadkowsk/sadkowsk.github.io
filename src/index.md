    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>

      Here, you can learn more about my journey—from a Senegalese community radio station to a meatpacking plant in Iowa.

      I currently serve as the Research Project Coordinator for the <em>Sesame Street</em> Archive (SSA) at Vanderbilt University’s Learning and Neurodevelopment (LaND) Lab. With prior experience teaching English as an additional language and coordinating educational startup initiatives, I bring a focus on technology ethics and the long-term educational impacts of AI on children. At the LaND Lab, I strategize the SSA's growth as an open-access digital archive, actively supporting a fMRI dense longitudinal study on children's brain development and applying the SSA in computer vision modeling. My responsibilities include managing project timelines and teams, as well as producing the SSA's written deliverables.

      My formal training encompasses data-driven policy analysis, program evaluation, and organizational management, with a focus on education interventions in international development. I earned my M.Ed. in International Education Policy and Management (a USDHS STEM program) from Vanderbilt University after completing my B.A. in History with a concentration in Global Development Studies at Grinnell College. I also hold a Business Essentials Credential of Readiness (CORe) Certificate from Harvard Business School Online.

      In my personal time, I enjoy cooking for friends, treasure hunting at garage sales, walking on trails, and petting every dog possible.

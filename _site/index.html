    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
<p>Here, you’ll learn about my work as an international educator—from a Senegalese community radio station to a meat packing plant in Iowa.</p>
<p>I currently serve as the project coordinator for the <em>Sesame Street</em> Archive, an initiative of the Learning and Neurodevelopment Lab at Vanderbilt University. Earning my M.Ed. in International Education Policy &amp; Management (Vanderbilt University ’24) and B.A. in History and Global Development Studies (Grinnell College ’16), my formal training includes data-informed policy analysis and program evaluation. My extensive international experiences and my Polish-Belarusian heritage also inform my commitment to education across borders.</p>
<p>In daily life, I enjoy cooking for friends, treasure hunting at garage sales, walking on trails, and smiling at passing strangers’ dogs.</p>
